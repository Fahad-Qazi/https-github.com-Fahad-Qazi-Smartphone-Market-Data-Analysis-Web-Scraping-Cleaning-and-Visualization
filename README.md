## üìÇ Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Acquisition (Web Scraping)
- Implemented a **Selenium-based scraper** with `undetected-chromedriver` to handle JavaScript-rendered pages and bypass anti-bot detection.
- Applied **automated filters** (New Mobiles, Upcoming Mobiles) and **infinite scrolling** to dynamically load all smartphone listings.
- Captured the **entire HTML source** once all products were loaded.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Parsing & Extraction
- Parsed HTML using **BeautifulSoup** (`lxml` parser).
- Extracted structured smartphone attributes including:
  - Name, Price, Rating, Specs Score
  - SIM type, Processor details
  - RAM & Storage
  - Battery capacity, Display specifications
  - Camera details, OS type, Memory card support

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Converted raw text into **analysis-ready formats**:
  - Removed currency symbols and converted prices to integers
  - Extracted numeric values for battery capacity, RAM, and storage
  - Standardized feature naming conventions
- Handled missing values and normalized data types.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Analysis & Visualization
- Formulated **10 analytical questions** to uncover market insights, such as:
  - Feature-to-price correlations
  - Specs score vs. price trends
  - Feature popularity (5G, NFC, AMOLED)
  - Brand-wise feature distribution
- Visualized findings with:
  - **Price distribution histograms**
  - **Correlation heatmaps**
  - **Bar charts** for brand and feature counts
  - **Scatter plots** to highlight value-for-money devices

## üìä Example Insights
- Identified **top-performing smartphones** by specs score-to-price ratio.
- Found clear trends in **flagship vs. budget devices**:
  - Higher refresh rates and battery capacities in flagship models
  - Budget devices focusing on battery life over display performance
- Revealed **brand strategies** through feature combinations.
